# Beyond - 'influencers' coding challenge

## Get started

- Clone repo then run `npm i` in both **client** and **server** folders
- In **server** folder, run `npm run dev`
- Open `http://localhost:5174/` to see app - [link](http://localhost:5174/)

## What I'd do next...

- Reveal further insights in to the data, giving the user more search and filter options to find out specific information.
- Work on the UI; making it responsive, improving the design, and adding intuitive ways to interact with the app to facilitate the things mentioned in the previous point.
- Add a form so that more data could be added / deleted / edited.
- Connect to an API that would dynamically update the data as the numbers change over time.

## How would I improve it...

1.  Improve the user interface: Enhancing it by adding features such as search filters, sorting options, and pagination. 
    
2.  Use a database: Storing data in a CSV file is not efficient for scaling purposes. Using a database would be better, making it easier to manage and search the data.

3.  Use caching: Caching would improve performance. A caching mechanism could store frequently accessed data in memory.
